# Pong
Implementation of the classic 1-player Pong game using only OpenCV HighGUI functions drawing over a Numpy image.
The player uses 'a' and 'd' keys to move the paddle left and right. The difficulty level keeps increasing as the game goes on.
To run the game, download the files and run game.py, and include the playerâ€™s name in the command line (Eg. python3 game.py player1)
